Add on library for ruby-openid which adds support for the discovery protocol used
by Google Apps.AN AMAZING PROJECT

To install:
  gem install ruby-openid-apps-discovery

To use:
  require 'gapps_openid'

Use the ruby-openid library as normal (also works with rack-openid or any other
derivative of ruby-openid.)  To start discovery on a Google Apps domain,
simply use the domain name as the identifier.
